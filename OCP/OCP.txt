Definiton

The Open Closed Principle (OCP) is the SOLID principle which states that the software entities (classes or methods) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
But what does this really mean?

Basically, we should strive to write a code that doesn’t require modification every time a customer changes its request. 
Providing such a solution where we can extend the behavior of a class (with that additional customer’s request) and not modify that class, 
should be our goal most of the time.



Excercise 

So, all of this is working great, but now our boss comes to our office and says that we need a different calculation for the senior and junior developers.
The senior developers should have a bonus of 20% on a salary.
